Cheatsheet
This is a reference list of the most commonly used Git commands. (You might consider bookmarking this handy page.) Try to familiarize yourself with the commands so that you can eventually remember them all:

Commands related to a remote repository:
git clone git@github.com:USER-NAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git
git push or git push origin main (Both accomplish the same goal in this context)
Commands related to the workflow:
git add .
git commit -m "A message describing what you have done to make this snapshot different"
Commands related to checking status or log history
git status
git log
The basic Git syntax is program | action | destination.

For example,

git add . is read as git | add | ., where the period represents everything in the current directory;
git commit -m "message" is read as git | commit -m | "message"; and
git status is read as git | status | (no destination).
Git Best Practices
There’s a lot to learn about using Git. But it is worth taking the time to highlight some best practices so that you can be a better collaborator. Git is not only helpful when collaborating with others. It’s also useful when working independently. You will be relying more and more on your own commit history in the future when revisiting old code.

Two helpful best practices to consider are atomic commits and leveraging those atomic commits to make your commit messages more useful to future collaborators.

An atomic commit is a commit that includes changes related to only one feature or task of your program. There are two main reasons for doing this: first, if something you change turns out to cause some problems, it is easy to revert the specific change without losing other changes; and second, it enables you to write better commit messages.

Changing the Git Commit Message Editor
If you are using Visual Studio Code (and you should be if you’re following this curriculum) and you don’t want to get stuck writing a commit message in Vim because you accidentally used git commit without the message flag (-m), this command will make Visual Studio Code open a new tab with the ability to write your commit message and an optional description below it: git config --global core.editor "code --wait".

There will be no confirmation or any output on the terminal after entering this command. To make a commit with Visual Studio Code as the text editor, make sure to use the git commit command without the -m flag. Just type git commit and no message after that. Once you do this, a new tab will open. Now you can write your message, and provide more information if you want, right below it. After typing your commit message, save it and exit the tab.

With that out of the way, now you can choose to use either git commit -m <your message here> or git commit and enter your message with Visual Studio Code!

Conclusion
You may not feel completely comfortable with Git at this point, which is normal. It’s a skill that you will get more comfortable with as you use it.

The main thing to take away from this lesson is the basic workflow. The commands you’ve learned here are the ones you will be using the most often with Git.

Don’t worry if you don’t know all the commands yet or if they aren’t quite sticking in your memory yet. They will soon be seared into your brain as you use them over and over in future Odin projects.

In later Git lessons, we will cover some of the more advanced Git features, such as branches. They will further expand your abilities and make you more productive.

For now, concentrate on using the basics of Git that you’ve learned here for all of your projects from now on. You will soon know each of the basic Git commands from memory!
